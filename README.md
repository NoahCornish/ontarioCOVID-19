# COVID-19 Ontario Public Health Unit's Data
In this repository you can access the shapefile I use to map the data as well as the CSV file I use.
This data has been complied from multiple sources and the Open Data from the Government of Ontario

NOTE:
Test1.csv contains most of the data I have complied since the start of 2021
Ontario R values will be updated once a week (Saturdays).

All other files will be updated daily
